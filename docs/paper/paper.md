# Summary

toqito is a Python package for studying various aspects of quantum information
theory. Specifically, toqito focuses on providing numerical tools to study
problems pertaining to entanglement theory, nonlocal games, matrix analysis,
and other aspects of quantum information that are often associated with
computer science. While there are many outstanding feature-rich Python packages
to study quantum information, they are often focused on applications pertaining
to physics[johansson2013qutip]. Other excellent software offerings that are closer in scope to
toqito, such as QETLAB[johnston2016qetlab], are written in non-opensource languages and therefore
require the users to have access to costly licenses.

toqito aims to fill the needs of quantum information researchers working 

toqito is released under the BSD 3-Clause License and is available from GitHub and PyPI.[@johnston2016qetlab]
