# ToQITo (Theory of Quantum Information Toolkit)

Suite of Python tools that come in handy when considering various concepts in quantum information.

The inspiration for this package is heavily influenced by the 
[QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com) package in MATLAB. Many of the functions found 
here are direct ports of those functions converted into Python code.

 
## Testing

The `nose` module is used for testing. To run the suite of tests for `toqito`, run the following command in the 
root directory of this project.

    nosetests --with-coverage --cover-erase --cover-package .
