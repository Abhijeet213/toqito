The inspiration for this package is heavily influenced by the
[QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com) package in MATLAB by Nathaniel Johnston.  Many
of the functions found here are direct ports of those functions converted into
Python code.

## Usage

The following lists the current functionality of `toqito`. Each bullet item 
currently links to or will link to a Jupyter notebook file that showcases the
usage.

Filling in the jupyter notebook example files lags behind the features
presently offered in `toqito` and will be periodically updated as time allows.
